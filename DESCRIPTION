Description: The recount3 package enables access to a large amount of uniformly
    processed RNA-seq data from human and mouse. You can download
    RangedSummarizedExperiment objects at the gene, exon or exon-exon junctions
    level with sample metadata and QC statistics. In addition we provide access
    to sample coverage BigWig files.
