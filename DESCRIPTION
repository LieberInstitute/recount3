Description: Explore and download data from the recount project available at
    https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3/. Using the recount3 package
    you can download RangedSummarizedExperiment objects at the gene, exon or
    exon-exon junctions level, the raw counts, the phenotype metadata used,
    the urls to the sample coverage bigWig files or the mean coverage bigWig
    file for a particular study. The RangedSummarizedExperiment objects can be
    used by different packages for performing differential expression analysis.
    Using http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder you can perform
    annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the
    recount3 project as described at 
    http://doi.org/TODO.
