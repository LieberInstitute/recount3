Explore and download data from the recount project available at the [recount3 website](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3/). Using the `recount3` package you can download _RangedSummarizedExperiment_ objects at the gene, exon or exon-exon junctions level, the raw counts, the phenotype metadata used, the urls to the sample coverage bigWig files or the mean coverage bigWig file for a particular study. The _RangedSummarizedExperiment_ objects can be used by different packages for performing differential expression analysis. Using [derfinder](http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder) you can perform annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the recount project. 

For more information about `recount3` check the vignettes [through Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3) or at the [documentation website](http://lieberinstitute.github.io/recount3).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `recount3` using from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("recount3")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('recount3')` in R. Please 
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __recount3__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('recount3')}
citation('recount3')
```

Please note that the `recount3` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors. We have cited their work either in the pre-print or the vignette of the R package.

## Code of conduct


Please note that the `recount3` project is released with a
  [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Development tools

* Testing on Bioc-devel is possible thanks to [R Travis](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/) and [GitHub actions through `usethis`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/).
* Code coverage assessment is possible thanks to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh).
* The [documentation website](http://lieberinstitute.github.io/recount3) is automatically updated thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('pkgdown')`.
